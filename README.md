## 🏆 Challenge Story

This project was born from passion and determination. With just 24 hours before the deadline, I discovered the Frontend Challenge: Office Edition and was immediately inspired by Axero's vision of transforming workplace collaboration. Despite the time constraint, I was determined to create something truly special that would honor both the technical requirements and creative spirit of the challenge.

Working through the night, I crafted NexusHub as more than just an intranet - it's a digital workspace that celebrates office culture while providing genuine utility. Every floating coffee cup tells the story of colleague connections, every animated progress bar represents shared achievements, and every interactive element reflects the joy of productive collaboration.
